## Data

- Dataset: [Movie Data](data/movie_data.csv)
- Columns: name, rating, genre, year, released, score, votes, director, writer, star, country, budget, gross, company, runtime

## Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning:** We performed data cleaning, including handling missing values, ensuring consistency, and removing duplicates.

2. **Visualization:** We used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that help us explore and understand the relationships between different variables in the movie dataset.

3. **Correlation Analysis:** We computed the correlation matrix to quantify and analyze the relationships between variables. Notable correlations include the strong relationship between budget and gross earnings.

## Findings

- Budget is positively correlated with gross earnings, indicating that movies with higher budgets tend to earn more.
- Votes are also positively correlated with gross earnings, suggesting that popular movies tend to perform better financially.
- Surprisingly, the company is not highly correlated with gross earnings, implying that other factors may influence a movie's financial success.
